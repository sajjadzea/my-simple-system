# My Simple System

This project visualizes a network of nodes and links. It provides a simple D3-based interface for exploring connections and includes sample tests for the helper functions.

## Running the app

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the interactive graph.

## Running tests

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Execute the test suite:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   Or directly run:
   ```bash
   node tests/utils.test.js
   ```

This runs the small test suite verifying some utility functions in `main.js`.
